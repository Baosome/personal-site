// FIX: Replaced JSX syntax with React.createElement to be compatible with .ts files.
// The TypeScript compiler interprets JSX syntax as type assertions in .ts files, causing compilation errors.
// Using React.createElement() avoids this issue by creating React elements through function calls instead of JSX tags.
